# mappa_mus_ita
Choropleth map showing Italian museums that received at least one million visitors between 2018 and 2022.


The data on the number of visitors comes from a data analysis project I previously conducted using SAS for work. Python was then used to create this map more efficiently.

Geolocation data for Italian municipalities was sourced from the following public repository:
